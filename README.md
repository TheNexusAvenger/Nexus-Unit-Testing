**Nexus Unit Testing** is a unit testing framework meant to
simplify unit testing on the Roblox platform. The framework
uses assertion based unit testing. This is an alternative to
Roblox's [TestEZ](https://github.com/Roblox/testez). All
included utilities can be used with any framework, but are
intended to be used on the Roblox platform.
