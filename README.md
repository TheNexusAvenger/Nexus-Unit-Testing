**Nexus Unit Testing** is a unit testing framework meant to
simplify unit testing on the Roblox platform. The framework
uses assertion based unit testing. This is an alternative to
Roblox's [TestEZ](https://github.com/Roblox/testez). All
included utilities can be used with any framework, but are
intended to be used on the Roblox platform.

## Documentation
Documentation for the framework and utilities can be found
on the [GitHub pages](https://thenexusavenger.github.io/Nexus-Unit-Testing)
for this project. The [docs folder](docs) can also be used since it has all
of the markdown files.
